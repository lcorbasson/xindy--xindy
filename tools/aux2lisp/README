This directory contains some utilities that can be use to make xindy
compatible with TeX. Since xindy uses a completely new
indexstyle-scheme we can't be 100% compatible. makeindex-3 made a
bunch of assumptions about the index which don't hold for xindy. Due
to this fact we must make some workarounds. The programs herein are
made for these purposes.

The files in this directory are under development. If you find bugs or
can give us hints to improve some of the programs, mail us and we will
incorporate your ideas. If you also have written useful frontends to
xindy, send us. We'll add them to our collection.

Enjoy, Roger.
