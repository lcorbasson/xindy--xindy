This directory contains some utilities that convert LaTeX idx files to
xindy raw index format.

tex2xindy is the program that's currently used.
I.e., the xindy script wrapper knows about tex2xindy and uses it as
LaTeX index reader.

aux2lisp.pl is not used anymore, but kept for reference. You can use
it as an example script if you want to write some other input
converters. Roger Kehr found it more convenient to re-implement that
task as an FSA, using lex. It is actually not known why he made that
change, and didn't use Parse::RecDescent or something similar
powerful.

Usage of makeindex4 is depreciated as well; it's superseded by
texindy. It does one thing better as texindy: It supports arbitrary
cross-reference classes and instantiates them dynamically. In fact, it
parses LaTeX idx files for cross reference classes and outputs
according xindy clauses to a temporary xindy style file. For that
reason and because it's used, it's not removed from distribution yet.
