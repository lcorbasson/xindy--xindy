\chapter{Module \module{location-reference}}

%\ModuleTitle{}

\section{Introduction}

This module implements the abstract data types \type{location-class}
and \type{location-reference}. The first one describes the structure
of a location-class, how it is composed of basetypes, what are the
separators between the hierarchies (if there are). The second creates
instances of location-references by matching a string against a
location-class description. It further presents an interface to sort
location-references by order. The last part of this module deals with
the creation of so-called \term{ranges}, which combines a set of
successive location-references into the pair of location-references
that is composed of the left- and rightmost element. Additionally a
general scheme for the markup of location-references and ranges is
included.

The module is separated into the following parts:
\begin{deflist}{XXXXXXX}
\item [basetype]
\item [locclass]
\item [locref]
\item [ranges]
\end{deflist}
