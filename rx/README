This directory holds the code for the run time engine of xindy.
In particular
 -- the ordrules module
 -- xindy rte version number

These are CLISP extensions that must be dumped to create the memory
image base.mem that is used to compile xindy sources. Do not expect to
use this source as is -- it must be merged into a CLISP tree first.

This code has been used with CLISP 2.33.2.

The code is not necessarily clean. E.g. it is not clear if all
variables in the ordrules interface are really used in the xindy code,
or if we could spare their export. Also, the reliance on an available
regex.h is fine with the platforms where xindy runs up to now; but may
not be true in the future.

Some stuff is unused but kept anyhow as it might be used (again) in
the future:

 -- config.h.in
    Should actually be created and used for the C code. This file has
    been copied from CLISP's regexp module, but never put into use.
 -- xp*
    CL pretty printer. It is in CLISP now, and we don't need an
    external implementation any more. But maybe an other Lisp needs
    it.
