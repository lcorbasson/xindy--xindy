This directory contains documentation to `xindy'.

The subdirectory ./tutorial/ contains the examples that are used in
the tutorial.


SGML files use the LINUXDOC document type. This was used by the Linux
Documentation Project, but is not developed further. So, migration to
DocBook is planned for the future.


xindy-by-topic.sgml and report.sgml are obsolete.
xindy-by-topic.sgml has been transformed into faq.sgml;
report.sgml is a LaTeX document now, available as techrep.tex and
associated include files from CVS. I won't specify a directory here as
we plan to restructure the documentation directories anyhow.


faq.sgml and manual.sgml has been migrated to linuxdoc 1.0.9.
sgml2html works, sgml2latex has its big share of problems.
We haven't tried sgml2info or sgml2txt.

Actually, work should be put into migration to DocBook and into a
strategy that the generated HTML uses our layout. We see some
alternatives to do this, btw: (1) Generate HTML and use the generated
files as template files for HTML::Template, (2) generate XML and use
our generic XSL scripts, (3) rebuild our XSL scripts in DSSSL, (4) or
use DocBook XML from the start.
