This directory contains documentation to `xindy'.

Note: The documents for GNU Info and the plain text file are a little
      bit clumsy since they were generated from a SGML-document
      automatically. The TeX and HTML versions look better.

The subdirectory ./tutorial/ contains the examples that are used in
the tutorial.
