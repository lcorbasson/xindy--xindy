<sect>About <bf/xindy/

<p>
<bf/xindy/ means fle<bf/x/ible <bf/ind/exing s<bf/y/stem. It is an
indexing system that can be used to generate book-like indexes for
arbitrary text-formatting systems. This term includes systems such as
TeX and LaTeX, the roff-familiy or SGML-based systems that process
some kind of text and generate a special output-file. It is not fixed
to any specific system, but can be configured for a wide variety of
purposes.

Those systems usually don't have the capability to build an index of
their own, but use other tools to do these work. Such tools are often
called <em/indexing systems/ or <em/indexers/. <bf/xindy/ is such a
system that takes some input data (the <em/raw-index/) and a
description how to process and markup the raw-index (the so-called
<em/index-style/) and builds wonderful indexes that can be fed back
into the text-formatting system.



<sect>Introduction

<p>

This section should give you some general information about indexing.

<sect1>A brief overview on indexing

<p>
The index of a book is sometimes as valuable as the contents of the
book. A good index supports the readers work and guides him quickly to
the desired information.

<quote><em>
The compiling of an index is interesting work, though some authors are
apt to find it tedious and delegate the work to others. The
proofreader who undertakes it will find that it is splendid mental
exercise and brings out his latent editorial capability.
</em></quote>

<quote>
Albert H. Highton, <em/Practical Proofreading/ (1926)
</quote>

Compiling an index can be separated into two different tasks. The
first one is to figure out what terms should appear in the index. As
D. E. Knuth tells us

<quote><em>Sometimes it is desirable to index words that don't
actually appear on the page. ... For example, Appendix I lists page 1
under `beauty', even though page 1 only contains the word `beautiful'.
(The author felt that it was important to index `beauty' because he
had already indexed `truth'.) </em>
</quote>

<quote>
Donald E. Knuth, <em/The TeXbook/ (1984)
</quote>

The second task to be mastered is to actually compile the index. This
is a rather tediuos and error-prone process that should be entirely
left to computers. Indexing systems such as xindy don't support the
author in deciding which terms should appear in the index. They master
the second task after one has written a specification how the
indexentries should be sorted, merged and finally tagged with the
appropriate markup.


<sect1>History

<p>
In 1987 the <tt/makeindex/-system was developed by Pheong Chen and
others that gave the large community of TeX/LaTeX users a tool to
easily build indexes and include them into their own documents. In the
following years it became a de facto standard in the TeX-community.
Its markup is configurable and one build do a lot of pretty indexes
with it.

But some problems were discovered right soon after users in
non-english speaking countries tried to use it for their own purposes.
Since <tt/makeindex/ was not intended to be used for other languages
with other underlying alphabets, many people wished an
<em/international/ version of this system. In 1991 Joachim Schrod and
Gabor Herr implemented the <em/International MakeIndex/. It was called
<tt/makeindex-3/ since it was a rewrite of some parts of the older
<tt/makeindex-2/ by Chen. Some of the general problems concerning this
topic were solved and its major contribute was the fact that the
system was able to manage arbitrary alphabets and sort them by
user-definable rules.

But there were still a lot of wishes and it turned out, that the old
system was not extensible enough to allow major rewrites of the
source. In 1994 I started a project to reimplement the old
<tt/makeindex/-system and to introduce a bunch of new features. They
are described in section <ref id="why xindy">. So xindy can be viewed
as the third step in the tradition of <tt/makeindex/.


<sect1>Basic concepts

<p>
This section contains some basic information about indexes and
indexing systems. The experienced user may skip this section and
continue with section <ref id="how works" name="&dquot;How the index
processor works&dquot;">.

Text formatting systems or document preparation systems often need to
produce indexes of the documents they prepare. Very often these
systems aren't able to produce indexes on their own but use separate
specialsed tools for this purpose.

Usually the document systems produce some form data that describe the
<em/indexentries/ and the <em/locations/ they point to. This data is
called the <em/raw-index/ since it consists of a bunch of unformatted
information about the entries of the index. This raw-index is fed into
the indexer and processed accordingly to a specification called the
<em/indexstyle/. This is a user-definable description how the index is
to be processed, what sort-rules for the keywords should be used,
which kind of locations may appear, and finally, how and which tag
should be emitted when writing the index down to the output stream.
The result is sometimes fed back into the document preparation system
(as it is in the case of TeX) or used otherwise.

The xindy system is oriented on book-like indexes in a form that is
described later in detail. The format of the input data is fixed and a
small tool that converts the raw-index in a form suitable for xindy
shuld not be a hurdle at all. The user is normally not involved in the
correct format suitable for xindy and some tools will make this work
invisible to him. The exact specification is given in section
<ref id="raw index" name="&dquot;Raw index&dquot;">

In contrast, the output of the xindy system is highly configureable
and can produce a variety of different markups for an index.
Additionally, the way xindy processes the index data can be
parametrised and controlled in many ways and gives the user a powerful
framework for describing complex indexes. The user can learn to tell
xindy how it should produce an output according to his wishes or
simply use some of the predefined styles that com with the
distribution.

<sect1>Raw-index interface

<p>
The raw-index is the stream of data that represents the index that is
to be processed. Since many different document preparation systems may
use different forms of representing an index, their output must be
transformed in a form readable by xindy. We also could have written an
configurable parser performing this task, but usually a tool written
in some text processing tools such as <tt/perl/, <tt/sed/ or <tt/awk/
can achieve the same task as well. So adapting xindy to a completely
different system can mostly be done by writing an appropriate
raw-index filter.

The format of the raw-index interface of xindy defined as follows:

<code>
(indexentry :key string-list [:print string-list] [:attr string]
	    { { :locref string | [:open-range | :close-range] }
	    | { :xref string-list [:xref-type string] } } )
</code>

Here the braces <tt/[/ and <tt/]/ denote optional parts of the syntax
and <tt/{/ and <tt/}/ denote the groups of elements. However the
enclosing round braces <em/are/ part of the syntax and must be
supplied. The pseudo-variable <em/string/ is a sequence of characters
surrounded by double-quotes, e.g.

<tscreen><verb>
"Hi, it's me"  "one"  "a string with two \"double quotes\""
</verb></tscreen>

are three examples of valid strings. If you need to include a
double-qoute as a literal character, you must quote it itself with a
backslash as shown in the third example. A <em/string-list/ is simply
a list of strings separated by whitespaces and surrounded by round
braces. An example of a string-list is

<tscreen><verb>
("This" "is" "a" "list" "of" "strings")
</verb></tscreen>

So far about the syntax. The semantics of the different elements are
described here.

<p>
<descrip>

<tag/<tt/:key//The argument <em/string-list/ defines the keyword of
the indexentry. Is is a list of strings, since the keyword may consist
of different layers such as <tt>("heap" "fibonacci")</tt>. This
argument is mandatory.

<tag/<tt/:print//The optional <em/print-key/ defines the way the
keyword has to be printed in the markup phase.

<tag/<tt/:locref//The reference an indexentry describes can be a
<em/location-reference/ or a <em/cross-reference/. The switch
<tt/:locref/ describes a location-reference. Its optional arguments
are <tt/:open-range/ and <tt/:close-range/. The <em/string/ that must
be supplied must somehow encode the location-reference. It might look
like the string <tt/"25"/ representing the page number 25, or
<tt/"Appendix-I"/ representing the first appendix numbered in
uppercase roman numbers.

<tag/<tt/:open-range/,<tt/:close-range//These are switches that do not
take any arguments. They describe the beginning and ending of a
<em/range/, starting or ending from the location-reference that is
given by the argument <tt/:locref/. If they are supplied, the
location-reference may have influence on the way ranges are build.

<tag/<tt/:xref/,<tt/:xref-type//These arguments choose the second
alternative. The argument <em/string-list/ of parameter <tt/:xref/
describes where the indexentry should point to. The optinal parameter
<tt/:xref-type/ may be used to declare the cross-reference to be of a
certain type.

<tag/<tt/:attr//This parameter may be used to tag a location-reference
or a cross-reference with a certain attribute. For location-references
it parametries the way ranges are built. It may also used to associate
different markup for different attributes in the markup phase.

</descrip>

Some examples:

<tscreen><verb> (indexentry :key ("airplane") :locref "25") </verb></tscreen>
defines an indexentry with the key 'airplane' and indexed on page
'25'.

<tscreen><verb> (indexentry :key ("house") :xref ("building"))
</verb></tscreen> defines a cross-reference with the key 'house'
pointing to the term 'building'.

<tscreen><verb> (indexentry :key ("house") :xref ("building") :open-range)
</verb></tscreen> is an invalid specification, since <tt/:open-range/
mustn't be used together with cross-references.
