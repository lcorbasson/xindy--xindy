<sect>About <bf/xindy/

<p>

<bf/xindy/ means fle<bf/x/ible <bf/ind/exing s<bf/y/stem. It is an
indexing system that can be used to generate book-like indexes for
arbitrary text-formatting systems. This term includes systems such as
TeX and LaTeX, the roff-familiy or SGML-based systems that process
some kind of text and generate a special output-file. It is not fixed
to any specific system, but can be configured for a wide variety of
purposes.
<p>

Those systems usually don't have the capability to build an index of
their own, but use other tools to do these work. Such tools are often
called <em/indexing systems/ or <em/indexers/. <bf/xindy/ is such a
system that takes some input data (the <em/raw-index/) and a
description how to process and markup the raw-index (the so-called
<em/index-style/) and builds wonderful indexes that can be fed back
into the text-formatting system.
