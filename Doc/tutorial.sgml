<abstract>
This is a tutorial for the <sf/xindy/ indexing system. <sf/xindy/ is a
general purpose index processor that can be configured for a variety
of document preparation system. We will demonstrate step by step the
incremental specification of a complete indexstyle. The examples are
based on indexes that are delivered with the system so one can get
acquainted with it practically.

<sect>Motivation
<p>


<sect>Why using <sf/xindy/?
<p>
In comparison to other index processors <sf/xindy/ has several
powerful features that make it an ideal framework for describing and
generating complex indices. Its most interesting features are

<descrip>

<tag/Internationality/ <sf/xindy/ can be configured to process indices
for many languages with different letter sets and different sorting
rules. For example, many roman languages such as Italian, French,
Portuguese or Spanish contain accentuated letters such as &Agrave;,
&Aacute;, &ntilde;. Other languages from northern Europe have letters
like &Auml;, &Oslash;, &aelig; or &szlig; which often can't be
processed by many index processors not talking about sorting them
correctly into an index. The <sf/xindy/-system can be configured to
process these alphabets by defining <em/sort-/ and <em/merge-rules/
that allow expressing of language specific rules. One example of such
a rule would be

<tscreen><verb>
(sort-rule "ä" "ae")
</verb></tscreen>

defining that a word containing the umlaut-a will be sorted as if it
contained the letters <tt/ae/ instead. This is one form of how the
umlaut-a is sorted into german indices. With an appropriate set of
rules on can express the complete rules of a specific language.

<tag/User-definable Location Types/ Locations are the entities an
indexentry points to. Often used locations are <em/page numbers/,
<em/section-numbers/, etc. <sf/xindy/ allows to define new kinds of
types to be composed of smaller entities like arabic numbers, roman
numbers, letters, etc. which can be used to describe new index types.
Examples of these entities can be books that have a page numbering
scheme that starts from 1 for each new chapter resulting in page
numbers of the form <em/1-13, 2-15, 2-20/, etc. This type of locations
can often be found in computer manuals. A more complex structure is
represented by the locations <em/Psalm 46, 1-8/ and <em/Genesis 1,
31/. Even the structure of bible verses can be described allowing
<sf/xindy/ to correctly sort and process indices for documents with a
completely different structure.

<tag/Highly Configurable Markup/ Since a index processor is only one
component in a document preparation system it ought to fit smoothly
into the complete environment. Many text processing systems use the
concept of <em/environments/ that can be used to describe the markup
of the text entities. Our approach is based on this concept which has
proved to be expressive enough for most applications. As an example
one can view systems such as TeX, SGML and its instance HTML, GNU
Info, RTF and the Nroff-familiy of document formatters. The markup of
an index can be defined for all of these systems in a very comfortable
though extremly powerful way.

<sect>A Basic Introduction
<p>
This section incrementally introduces the most important parts of the
system. After reading and practicing this chapter you should be able
to specify about 80% of the commonly used indices. The examples are
demonstrated with a TeX-markup such that one can easily typeset the
results <sf/xindy/ produces. You need LaTeX2e and the ISO-Latin
enhancements that come with the <tt/inputenc/-package to run the
following examples. Also the <sf/xindy/-system must already be
installed.


<sect1>Running <sf/xindy/
<p>
Create a new directory somewhere and copy some files from the
distribution directory <tt>Doc/tutorial/</tt> by typing

<tscreen><verb>
eg$ mkdir tutorial
eg$ cd tutorial
eg$ cp <distrib-dir>/Doc/tutorial/*.raw .
</verb></tscreen>

with <tt/distrib-dir/ replaced by the actual location. Now create a
file <tt/style1.xdy/ with the following content:

<tscreen><verb>
;; This is a first example using `xindy'.

(define-location-class "page-numbers" ("arabic-numbers"))
(define-attributes (("definition" "usage")))
</verb></tscreen>

Now run <sf/xindy/ by typing

<tscreen><verb>
eg$ xindy -l ex1.xlg style1.xdy ex1.raw
</verb></tscreen>

You should see something like

<tscreen><verb>

</verb></tscreen>

<sf/xindy/ has now successfully compiled the index <tt/ex1.raw/ using
your indexstyle <tt/style1.xdy/. The result is now stored in file
<tt/ex1.ind/. You can view this file but currently it only contains an
unreadable mix of data.

But now let's come back to our indexstyle. What is the meaning of the
two commands we specified? The first command informed <sf/xindy/ that
we like to process page numbers. We do this by defining a new
<em/location-class/ named <tt/page-numbers/. The page numbers consist
of <tt/arabic-numbers/ as we might expect but this is not necessarily
true---imagine your page numbers consisted of Roman numbers instead.
When reading the <em/raw-index/ contained in file <tt/ex1.raw/
<sf/xindy/ checks all locations if they match all known
location-classes. Since in our example the only known location-class
is the class of page numbers which are written using arabic digits,
all locations will be checked if they are correct page numbers.

The second command tells <sf/xindy/ that we use two types of
attributes for location-references. Most often the locations in an
index denote different meanings. For example, in mathematical texts
one will distinguish the <em/definition/ of a term from its
<em/usage/. Sometimes these are typeset using different font-shapes
such as <em/italic/ or <bf/boldface/. Each location has an associated
attribute which, if it is unspecified, defaults to the attribute
<tt/default/. With this command you have made these attributes known
to the system, which later on makes it possible to assign different
markup for these attributes.


<sect1>Adding some Markup
<p>
Until now you haven't seen something exciting, so its time to specify
some markup. Add the following lines to our indexstyle:

<tscreen><verb>
(markup-index :open  "\n\\begin{theindex}\n"
	      :close "\n\\end{theindex}\n"
	      :tree)

(markup-locref :class "page-numbers" :attr "definition"
	       :open  "{\\bf " :close "}")

(markup-locclass-list :open "\\quad")
(markup-locref-list :sep ", ")
</verb></tscreen>

Now run <sf/xindy/ again and afterwards LaTeX

<tscreen><verb>
eg$ xindy -l ex1.xlg style1.xdy ex1.raw
eg$ latex ex1.tex
</verb></tscreen>

You can view <tt/ex1.dvi/ with your prefered viewer (maybe <tt/xdvi/
or something else) to get a first impression of your results. Maybe
your are not satisfied (for sure you aren't), because it still looks
very confusing. What did the above rules tell <sf/xindy/? When you
view the file <tt/ex1.ind/ which is the result <sf/xindy/ generates,
you'll recognize some of the <em/markup tags/ you specified. The
following is an excerpt of this file.

<tscreen><verb>
\begin{theindex}
  academia\quad{}{\bf 1}acafetado\quad{}{\bf 2}acalmar\quad{}{\bf 4}
  açafrão\quad{}{\bf 3}indexflat\quad{}1hierarchical\quad{}2
  veryhierarchical\quad{}3impressive\quad{}4saber\quad{}{\bf 7}
  sabor\quad{}{\bf 8}sabão\quad{}{\bf 6}sábado\quad{}{\bf 5}
\end{theindex}
</verb></tscreen>

First of all you'll see that the file starts with the string
<vb>\begin{theindex}</vb> and ends with <vb>\end{theindex}</vb>.
Additionally some locations are correctly enclosed into a TeX-macro
that typesets them in shape boldface, whereas others aren't. The
boldface ones are all those locations from the raw-index that have the
attribute <tt/definition/.

The <tt/:open/ and <tt/:close/ keyword-arguments each take a string as
argument. The first one is written to the file when <em/opening/ an
enviroment, whereas the latter one <em/closes/ an environment. What we
have specified is the markup for the whole index (which is actually
printed only once) and the markup for all locations of class
<tt/page-numbers/ which own the attribute <tt/definition/. Here we
have cleanly separated the structured markup from the visual one,
allowing an easy redefinition if we decide, for example, to markup the
<tt/definition/-locations in italics instead of boldface.

The third command caused <sf/xindy/ to insert a horzontal space
between the kewyord and the locations (the TeX-command
<vb>\quad{}</vb> simply inserts a specific horizontal space). The last
command caused <sf/xindy/ to separate all location-references from
each other with a comma followed by a blank, independently of any
location-class.

As you already have observed the backslashes serve as a <em/quoting
character/.

We continue specifying markup to get a printable result by adding more
markup:

<tscreen><verb>
(markup-indexentry :open "\n  \\item "           :depth 0)
(markup-indexentry :open "\n    \\subitem "      :depth 1)
(markup-indexentry :open "\n      \\subsubitem " :depth 2)
</verb></tscreen>

This assigns different markup for the different hierarchy layers of
the indexentries. Our index is hierarchically organized. It contains
items which themselves contain more sub-items which also might contain
sub-sub-items. Each layer is started by a different markup which is
correctly assigned with the <tt/:depth/ keyword-argument. The layers
are numbered by their <em/depth/ starting from zero.

Now run <sf/xindy/ and TeX again and enjoy your first index. It's
easy, isn't it. The output <tt/ex1.ind/ looks like the following:

<tscreen><verb>
\begin{theindex}

 \item academia\quad{}{\bf 1}
 \item acafetado\quad{}{\bf 2}
 \item acalmar\quad{}{\bf 4}
 \item açafrão\quad{}{\bf 3}
 \item index
    \subitem flat\quad{}1
    \subitem hierarchical\quad{}2
    \subitem very
      \subsubitem hierarchical\quad{}3
      \subsubitem impressive\quad{}4
 \item saber\quad{}{\bf 7}
 \item sabor\quad{}{\bf 8}
 \item sabão\quad{}{\bf 6}
 \item sábado\quad{}{\bf 5}

\end{theindex}
</verb></tscreen>

Hmm, as you might have seen there are several problems that need
further investigation. The index contains some Portuguese words that
are printed correctly but should appear at other positions inside the
index. For instance, the word <em/sábado/ should appear before the
word <em/saber/ since <em/á/ must be sorted as if it were simply an
<em/a/. The reason is simple---the accentuated letters have codes
beyond position 128 in the ISO-Latin alphabet. Sorting based on these
codes yields this incorrect order.

What to do? We can define for each of the words containing these
special characters an explicit <em/print-key/. The print-key describes
the printed representation of the keyword whereas the <em/key/ or
<em/main-key/ is used for sorting and merging. A very tedious task
which is not a very clever solution since in a non-english language
many many words contain these special cases. We follow the way
<sf/xindy/ offers---<em/keyword-mappings/.

<sect1>Keyword mappings
<p>
What good are keyword-mappings for? A good question. I'll try to give
some answers.

<itemize>

<item> <em/Merging of differently written words/. Some text-formatting
systems allow different writings for the same word. For example, TeX
can be used with ISO-Latin characters as well as with its own
character sequences. If a document is composed from smaller ones
possibly written by different authors using different forms of writing
the indexentries, the same terms may happen to be written differently
and consequently we need a mechanism to identify them as equal.

<item> <em/Specifying the sort order/. As outlined in the previous
section it is really difficult and error-prone to specify the sort-key
for each keyword explicitly. Sometimes the sort order is even
different for the type of the document, as it happens in German, where
two different types of sortings exist, one for everyday indexes and
one for dictionaries. The sort order actually defines the position of
arbitrary language-specific letters inside of an index.

</itemize>

A detailed development of the here only sketched ideas can be found in
the paper <em/An International Version of MakeIndex/ by Joachim
Schrod. It describes the ideas that led to modifications on one of the
ancestors of the <sf/xindy/-system---<tt/makeindex/.

The keyword-mappings are as follows. The <em/merge-key/ is generated
from the <em/main-key/ with the so called <em/merge-mapping/. The
merge-mapping can be specified with the command <tt/merge-rule/. The
<em/sort-key/ is derived from the merge-key using the
<em/sort-mapping/ specified with the <tt/sort-rule/ command. The
following scheme show this mapping process:

<quote>
<em/key/ + merge-mapping <f>&rarr;</f> <em/merge-key/ + sort-mapping
<f>&rarr;</f> <em/sort-key/
</quote>

We will use this command now to define a suitable sort-mapping that
fits our needs.

<tscreen><verb>
(sort-rule "à" "a")
(sort-rule "á" "a")
(sort-rule "ã" "a")
(sort-rule "è" "e")
(sort-rule "é" "e")
(sort-rule "ç" "c")
</verb></tscreen>

These rules define mappings from a keyword to a <em/normalized/
version. In the logfile <tt/ex1.xlg/ these transformations are logged so
that one can see how these mappings are performed. In this example we
do not need any <tt/merge-rule/ but we will see applications in
further examples.

Running <sf/xindy/ and TeXing the result now places the indexentries
at the right positions.

The result is now quite satisfying if the indexentries weren't clumped
together that much. We usually want the different indexentries
beginning with the same letter be optically separated from the ofhers.
This improves readability and there must be a way to accomplish
this---the <em/letter groups/.

<sect1>Letter Groups
<p>
To group indexentries we must define what indexentries form a group.
The clustering is done by matching the keywords' prefixes (taken from
the em/sort-key/) with a user-defined table of prefixes and define
appropriate markup that separates the groups from each other. Here it
goes.

<tscreen><verb>
(define-letter-groups
  ("a" "b" "c" "d" "e" "f" "g" "h" "i" "j" "k" "l" "m"
   "n" "o" "p" "q" "r" "s" "t" "u" "v" "w" "x" "y" "z"))

(markup-letter-group-list :sep "\n\\indexspace")
</verb></tscreen>

This defines the given list of letter groups. When forming the letter
groups, each letter group is checked if it matches a prefix of the
indexentries' sort-key. The longest match assigns the indexentry to
this letter group. If no match was possible the indexentry is put into
group <tt/default/.

The result looks now much better than before. You have now learned the
basic features that you need to specify everyday indices. In the next
chapter we'll continue to make you an expert in indexing.


<sect>Advanced Features
<p>
In the following sections you'll learn more about the features of
<sf/xindy/. We'll show you how you can define your own
location-classes, specify the letter-groups in more detail and bring
you close to more specfic markup-features. After reading this chapter
you should be able to master about 95% of the commonly used indices.


<sect1>Location-classes
<p>
We continue using a more complex index. Copy the current style to a
new file (now <tt/style2.xdy/) and run <sf/xindy/ on the raw-index
<tt/ex2.raw/ by typing

<tscreen><verb>
eg$ cp style1.xdy style2.xdy
eg$ xindy -l ex2.xlg style2.xdy ex2.raw
</verb></tscreen>

You should see some error messages indicating that something is
unknown to <sf/xindy/. What has happend? The messages should be
similar to the following snapshot:

<tscreen><verb>
 ...
WARNING:
location-reference "B-5" did not match any location-class! (ignored)
WARNING:
location-reference "C-8" did not match any location-class! (ignored)
WARNING:
location-reference "iv" did not match any location-class! (ignored)
WARNING:
location-reference "ii" did not match any location-class! (ignored)
 ...
</verb></tscreen>

The index contains new, and therefore unkown, location-classes. The
first one has an appendix-like style, whereas the second one seems to
be lowercase Roman numbers. <sf/xindy/ reported, that it doesn't know
these locations and therefore knows nothing about their internal
structure. We make them known to the system by adding the following
commands to the style-file.

<tscreen><verb>
(define-location-class "roman-pages" ("roman-numbers-lowercase"))
(define-location-class "appendices" ("ALPHA" :sep "-" "arabic-numbers"))
(define-location-class-order ("roman-pages" "appendices"))
</verb></tscreen>

The first command tells <sf/xindy/ that there exist some page-numbers
that are written with roman lowercase letters. The second one defines
the structure of the appendix-locations. They consist of three
elements, a capital letter, a separator---which is a hyphen in our
case---and finally an arabic number. To be able to correctly
distinguish separator strings from the names of the known
<em/basetypes/, the argument <tt/:sep/ indicates, that the following
is a separator. The last command simply says that the locations which
are Roman numbers shall appear before the appendix-locations. So far
we know three different basetypes. The built-in basetypes of
<sf/xindy/ are:

<descrip>
<tag/<tt/arabic-numbers// contains all positive numbers beginning with
zero: 0, 1, 2, ....

<tag/<tt/roman-numbers-uppercase/, <tt/roman-numbers-lowercase// the
roman numbers I, II, III, (IIII/IV), V, ... It contains the old and
new Roman number system. Two versions for uppercase and lowercase
letters are supported.

<tag/<tt/ALPHA/, <tt/alpha// The English alphabet (uppercase and
lowercase letters).

<tag/<tt/digits// the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 in that
order.
</descrip>

`Fine,', you'll say, `but what if my basetypes are completely
different?'. You're right! But <sf/xindy/ offers you to define your
own alphabets. For example, you can define a new alphabet by writing

<tscreen><verb>
(define-alphabet "my-personal-alphabet" ("Hi" "ho" "here" "I" "go"))
</verb></tscreen>

This is a valid alphabet that consists of 5 <em/letters/. You can now
define a location-class

<tscreen><verb>
(define-location-class "my-personal-class"
    ("my-personal-alphabet" :sep "-" "arabic-numbers"))
</verb></tscreen>

to match all of the following locations: <em/Hi-12, ho-2, here-709,
I-9, go-42/. <sf/xindy/ will recognize them and be able to sort them
according to your specification which says that <em/Hi/ comes before
all others and <em/here/ is exactly at the third position. So they
will be sorted lexicographically, layer by layer, until it can decide
which one is before or after the other. We have prepared a concrete
example. Do you remember the example we gave when we spoke about
indexing bible verses? This exactly matches the situation of such a
self-defined alphabet which could look like the following definitions:

<tscreen><verb>
(define-alphabet "bible-chapters"
    ("Genesis" "Exodus" "Leviticus" "Numbers" "Deuteronomy"
     ... ))
(define-location-class "bible-verses"
    ("bible-chapters" :sep " " "arabic-numbers" :sep "," "arabic-numbers"))
</verb></tscreen>

This description would match locations like <em/Genesis 1,3/,
<em/Exodus 7,8/, etc.

Now run LaTeX on <tt/ex2.tex/ and view the results. It looks a little
bit strange since <sf/xindy/ has automatically build ranges of
successive locations. The first locations of the indexentry <em/roman/
actually denote the range <em/ii/ until <em/iv/. <em/Ranges/ consist
of location-references. To typeset them correctly you can specify

<tscreen><verb>
(markup-range :sep "--")
</verb></tscreen>

This indicates that location-reference forming a range shall be
separated by a hyphen. Running <sf/xindy/ and LaTeX again gives a
better idea of how it should look like. Here is a part of the
generated output.

<tscreen><verb>
  ...
 \item appendices\quad{}A-1, A-7, A-11, B-3--B-5, C-1, C-8, C-12,
	 C-13, C-22, D-2, D-3, D-5, D-10
  ...
</verb></tscreen>

<sect1>Hierarchical Location-classes
<p>
Somehow a lot of space is wasted when looking at the first indexentry.
Modify the definition of the location-class for appendices as follows
an add the other commands as well.

<tscreen><verb>
(define-location-class "appendices"
                       ("ALPHA" :sep "-" "arabic-numbers")
		       :hierdepth 2)
(markup-locref-list           :sep "; " :depth 0 :class "appendices")
(markup-locref-list :open "~" :sep ", " :depth 1 :class "appendices")
</verb></tscreen>

Run <sf/xindy/ and view the output stored in <tt/ex2.ind/. The output
looks similar to the following:

<tscreen><verb>
  ...
 \item appendices\quad{}A~1, 7, 11; B~3--5; C~1, 8, 12, 13, 22;
	D~2, 3, 5, 10
  ...
</verb></tscreen>

You can see that the location-references of this class have been
transformed into a hierarchical structure caused by the
<tt/:hierdepth/-argument. Additionally we have specified markup for
the layers of this class separately for the depths 0 and 1. The
locations at depth 0 are separated by a `;' whereas the ones at depth
1 are separated by a `,'.

Maybe you get an impression why we named <sf/xindy/ a <em/flexible/
system.

<sect1>More about Letter-groups
<p>
More problems arise when using languages with different letter
schemes. Hungarian is an example. In Hungarian indices the words
beginning with the letters <em/Cs, Ly, Ny/ and more are printed in a
separate block. The words beginning with <em/Ly/, for example, appear
behind the words beginning with an <em/L/. <sf/xindy/ allows to define
this kind of letter-groups as well. Add the following lines to the
style-file.

<tscreen><verb>
(define-letter-group "ly" :after "l" :before "m")
(define-letter-group "ny" :after "n" :before "o")

(markup-letter-group :open-head "\n {\\bf " :close-head "}"
	             :capitalize)
</verb></tscreen>

The result looks like the following:


<tscreen><verb>
 ...
{\bf Ly}
 \item lyuk\quad{}1
 \item lyukas\quad{}2

 \indexspace

 {\bf M}
 \item maga\quad{}1
 \item magyar\quad{}2

 \indexspace

 {\bf N}
 \item nagy\quad{}1
 \item nagyon\quad{}9
 \item negy\quad{}4

 \indexspace

 {\bf Ny}
 \item nyelv\quad{}1
 \item nyolc\quad{}8
  ...
</verb></tscreen>

The result describes what the purpose of the above commands is. It
becomes prettier from step to step, doesn't it?

You have now learned most of the features of <sf/xindy/. Go playing
around a little bit. For a detailed description of all commands and
all their arguments and switches you should use the manual that comes
with this distribution.


<sect1>More Tips and Tricks
<p>
This section contains a collection of tips and tricks that are not
guided by examples.

<sect2>Advanced Keyword Mappings
<p>
Sometimes it is necessary to specify keyword-mappings that tell the
system to put something <em/behind/ something else. For instance, we'd
like to map the character <em/ö/ behind the letter <em/o/. No problem
if you use the special characters <vb>\b</vb> and <vb>\e</vb> which
are called the <em/beginning-/ and <em/ending/-characters. The first
letter lexicographically precedes all other letters whereas the latter
one comes after all others. Our mapping problem can now be specified
as follows.

<tscreen><verb>
(sort-rule "ö" "o\\e")
</verb></tscreen>

Now the <em/ö/ is directly positioned after the <em/o/. See the manual
for a detailed description of this feature. Also be informed that the
keyword-mappings can be specified with regular expressions. Rules of
the form

<tscreen><verb>
(merge-rule "[-$(){}\\]" "")
</verb></tscreen>

are possible. This on removes all letters of the defined letter class.
Regular expression substitutions are possible as well. Refer to the
manual for an exact description.


<sect2>Tracing the Markup-Tags
<p>
A very important feature is the ability to trace all markup-tags
<sf/xindy/ emits in the markup-phase. Simply use the command-line
switch <tt/-t/ or insert the command

<tscreen><verb>
(markup-trace :on)
</verb></tscreen>

into the indexstyle. This informs <sf/xindy/ to emit additional
pseudo-markup that can be used to understand and debug the
markup-phase. An example output might look like the following:

<tscreen><verb>
<INDEX:OPEN>
  <LETTER-GROUP-LIST:OPEN>
    <LETTER-GROUP:OPEN [0]>
      <INDEXENTRY-LIST:OPEN [0]>
        <INDEXENTRY:OPEN [0]>
          <KEYWORD-LIST:OPEN [0]>
            <KEYWORD:OPEN [0]>
 ...
</verb></tscreen>

Give it a try if you find yourself confused by your own markup
specification.


<sect2>Ignoring Markup-Tags
<p>
Sometimes it is necessary to hide some of the parts of the index. If
you have a text-formatter that allows comments or macros that possibly
expand to nothing, just define appropriate markup that makes things
invisible to the formatter. For example, with LaTeX you can define a
macro like this

<tscreen><verb>
\newcommand{\ignore}[1]{}
</verb></tscreen>

If you additionally define markup like this

<tscreen><verb>
(markup-index :open "\\ignore{" :close "}"
</verb></tscreen>

you can throw away the complete index if you like, which would be a
real pity!

I'd like to thank the following persons who mainly contributed to the
development of the <sf/xindy/-system---Joachim Schrod who was a very
inspiring senior partner despite the fact that he was sometimes very
busy, Klaus Guntermann who was always very sensitive for future
problems that might have arosen in many situations and finally Gabor
Herr who helped me with many problems I had in mastering Lisp, UNIX
boxes and many design decisions. Additionally I'd like to thank Prof.
Waldschmidt who financial supported the finishing of the project up to
its current state.
