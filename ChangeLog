	* Today I started setting up a completely new imake-environment
 	  for the xindy-project. After finally choosing the project-name
 	  and just before the theoretical project-presentation some
 	  housekeeping was absolutely neccessary to keep everything under
 	  control.

	  The complete project will be checked into CVS next week and I'll
	  continue implementing the LISP-kernel.

	  There will be a special directory for the paper (Report) and for
	  the presentation (Presentation).

	  I also changed the TeX-imake-module to be capable of managing a
	  TeX-source that is spread over multiple files. The modified
	  version now is part of the config-directory.
