  \begin{abstract}
    This report describes a simple though powerful context-based
    markup algorithm and its implementation.

    Markup algorithms are often used to tag data structures with
    markup for representation purposes. They often follow an
    event-dispatching mechanism that allows the declaration of markup
    tags depending on the context in which an event occurs.

    We describe the markup algorithm which is used in the \xindy index
    processor and show how the multi-method dispatching facilities of
    \CLOS can be easily exploited to obtain an efficient
    implementation.

\section{Introduction}

It is often necessary to output some data structure stored in main
memory into a data stream using some particular form of
\term{representation}.  Somehow this process can be seen as the
reverse work of a \term{parser}. The reasons for representing data
structures in a stream are often \term{persistence}, the need to store
the data structures for later reuse, and \term{structured markup},
making the representation further available for other post-processing
steps such as typesetting.

We are interested in the problem of \term{tagging} the data to obtain
a specific markup needed for typesetting purposes. This problem is
easily solvable as long as the way how markup is assigned to data
objects is fixed. In this case the markup process can be directly
coded into some algorithm.

If there is a need for \term{configurable markup}, the situation is
more complicated. For an illustration of the difference imagine a tree
consisting of nodes of different types that have to be output.
Usually one traverses the tree and emits appropriate markup tags when
moving from one node to another. This kind of markup is called
\term{environment-based markup}, since the objects (in this example
the nodes of the tree) are encapsulated into an environment of markup
tags.

In almost all cases the nodes of a particular type are tagged
uniformly in the same manner. This kind of markup is often used to
\term{dump} a representation of a tree into a data stream. However,
there are application domains for which one wants to make the issued
markup tags depending on the node's position within the tree.

Therefore, we can roughly divide the markup schemes into
\term{context-free} and \term{context-based} (or
\term{context-sensitive}) markup. In this paper we will further
concentrate on context-based markup.

The rest of this paper is organised as follows. In
section~\ref{relwrk} we first discuss existing systems that already
contributed solutions to this kind of problem. In section~\ref{CCBM}
we describe the application domain for which we needed a simpler
solution to the problem. Finally we present our traversing algorithm
and its efficient implementation in
\CLOS~\cite{Gabriel:White:Bobrow:cacm:1991,Keene:88,Steele:common-lisp-2}.



\section{Related Work}
\label{relwrk}

The problem of context-based markup has several interesting general
solutions. We briefly present the solutions of two different systems:
\COST~\cite{CoST} and \STIL~\cite{stil}. Both systems are intended as
back-ends for SGML \term{parsers}. SGML documents must conform to a
structure that is described in a BNF-like grammar, called the
\term{document type definition} (DTD). A document conforming to some
DTD can be represented as a tree having SGML \term{elements} as its
nodes. A SGML parser validates a document against its DTD and produces
a structural description of its contents, the so-called ESIS (Element
Structure Information Set).

Both systems read the output of a SGML-parser and construct an
internal representation of the tree. This tree is then traversed in
some order (typically preorder) and appropriate markup is output when
entering or leaving a node. The \term{context} of a node is different
in both systems. In \COST all nodes along the path from the root node
to the current node form a node's context. In \STIL the whole tree
forms a node's context.

Both systems allow to specify markup depending on the particular
context in a very powerful way. Each SGML element is represented as
the instance of a particular class (\COST uses [incr
Tcl]~\cite{McLennan:1995:NIT}, \STIL uses \CLOS as their underlying
object systems). When a node is entered or left an event is generated.
This essentially is a message sent to the current object whose class
must offer an appropriate callback method.

The user of these systems simply binds methods to these classes that
output the desired markup. Both systems offer a rich set of primitives
to make the context information available inside the method bodies
that have to be written by the end-user.

Thus, one can implement very powerful context-based markup strategies
with a mixture of declarative specification and functional
descriptions.



\section{A Configurable Context-Based Markup Scheme}
\label{CCBM}

\subsection{The Problem}

When implementing the \xindy index processor~\cite{xindy:tr} we were
faced with a similar though less complicated problem. After processing
the index its internal tree representation needs to be output
according to an user definable markup.

The nodes of the tree are instances of internally defined classes as
well as user-defined classes. An example of such user-defined classes
are the so-called \term{location classes} that can be specified in the
\term{index style}\footnote{The index style contains a description of
  the occuring location classes and other objects.}. Location classes
can be page numbers, section numbers, or other kinds of location
references for which a class definition must be supplied in the index
style. As the markup of different location classes may be different
(e.g.\ page numbers are encapsulated into other markup than section
numbers), we decided to offer to the users a context-based markup
scheme to be sufficient powerful. Other nodes in the tree are lists
containing other objects as elements.


For the intended application domain the functionality of systems such
as \textsc{Stil} was not appropriate and we aimed for a more efficient
solution to the markup problem.\footnote{Especially writing \CLOS
  methods cannot be expected by any non-programmer user.} As a first
restriction we decided to make available only a subset of the elements
along the path as a node's context. Furthermore we observed that in
many cases there is a need for making the attributes of an instance
accessible as context information.

After these simplification steps we ended up in a very simple model.
The context information for a particular node did not exceed four
different objects. The basic traversing order was preorder and events
were generated when entering a node and when leaving a node. For list
nodes we additionally generated an event when moving from one element
in the list to its successor.


\subsection{An Efficient Implementation in CLOS}

The implemented markup system consists of two parts, (1) the markup
algorithm traversing the data structure and raising appropriate
events, and (2) the user interface, establishing the corresponding
event bindings.

We continue with the description of the underlying context-based
markup scheme and the dispatching mechanism which is directly
implemented using \CLOS method calls. Finally we describe the user
interface responsible for the dynamic establishing of event bindings.



\subsubsection*{Context-Based Markup via Multi-Method Dispatch}
\label{sec:tagging}

The tagging process directly operates on the tree representation as
illustrated in figure~\ref{fig:index-tree}.
%%
\begin{sidewaysfigure}
  \begin{center}
    \input{index-tree.latex}
  \end{center}
  \caption{Skeleton tree structure of an index}
  \label{fig:index-tree}
\end{sidewaysfigure}
%%
For each inner node there exists a path from the root to the current
node. Starting from the root in figure~\ref{fig:index-tree}, such a
path could look like
%%
\def\emrm#1{\mbox{\normalfont\emph{#1}}}%%
{\small\begin{alltt}
       \emrm{index}
         \emrm{letter group =} "G"
           \emrm{index entry =} "foo"
             \emrm{location class =} "page-numbers"
               \emrm{attribute group =} 1
                 \emrm{location reference attribute =} "definition"
\end{alltt}}
%%
\noindent The context of an object consists of this path and all
attributes the object owns. In our system, an event is generated each
time a node is entered for the first time or left forever. The event
contains a certain subset of the information present in the current
context and passes this information to the dispatching unit.

In contrast to \STIL, which represents events as \CLOS method calls
using a \term{single-argument dispatch}, we use in \xindy{} the
\term{multi-method dispatch facilities} of \CLOS to implement the
event bindings. The current context of a node is entirely passed as
the method's arguments to the multi-method dispatcher of \CLOS that
finds the appropriate method. In \STIL{} there is only one method
bound to a class and the method itself is reponsible for issuing the
desired markup. Hence, the user of \STIL{} is forced to write a
\Lisp-function that (a) accesses the necessary context of the node
using functions, and (b) uses the results obtained from the context
queries to output appropriate markup. This functional description of
defining markup has been replaced in \xindy{} by a pattern-oriented,
purely declarative specification which is less powerful though in our
opinion better understandable by the end-user.

The method definitions make heavy use of the
\texttt{eql}-specialisation feature of method arguments. This feature
specialises a method not only on a certain class, which is usually the
case in traditional object-oriented languages, but rather specialises
on a single instance which can be determined at run-time. This allows
to specialise an event-binding to only a particular subset of the
context arguments.

A sample method that is called in response to an event generated when
entering a location reference owning the attribute \emph{definition},
belonging to class \emph{pagenums}, and being positioned at an
arbitrary depth is represented through the following method:

{\small\begin{verbatim}
   (defmethod do-markup-locref-open
       ((attr      (eql #<attribute "definition">))
        (locrefcls (eql #<class     "pagenums">))
        (depth     number))
     (do-markup-string "\macro{"))
\end{verbatim}
    }

\noindent This method simply outputs the string ``\verb|\macro{|'' to
  the markup stream. It is specialised\footnote{Specialisation is done
    with the argument to the \texttt{eql}-specialiser. The notation
    \texttt{\#<...>} simply denotes an instance of some class.} to an
  attribute instance and a location reference class
  instance\footnote{In the \xindy{}-implementation location classes
    are themselves instances of another class.}. The above method is
  specialised to only two of three arguments. Since the argument
  \texttt{depth} is not specialised any further this method matches
  all location references of the given class and attribute appearing
  at any depth.


\subsubsection*{The User Interface}

The user interface is primarily responsible to establish appropriate
event-bindings. Since event bindings are implemented as \CLOS methods
the user interface consists of \Lisp macros expanding to appropriate
method definitions. Defining methods at run-time is a very powerful
property of \CLOS on which this approach relies mostly.

\newpage

\noindent All markup commands in index style have the following form:
%%
\def\itarg#1{\mbox{\normalfont\emph{#1}}}
\def\rmarg#1{\mbox{\normalfont #1}}
{\small\begin{alltt}
   (markup-\itarg{index-tree-node-name}
       \rmarg{[}:open \itarg{markup}\rmarg{]} \rmarg{[}:close \itarg{markup}\rmarg{]} \rmarg{[}:sep \itarg{markup}\rmarg{]}\footnote{Option \texttt{:sep} is applicable for list nodes only.}
       \rmarg{[\emph{context-dependent options such as} \texttt{:attr}, \texttt{:group}, \texttt{:class}, \texttt{:depth}, \ldots]})
\end{alltt}}

\enlargethispage{\baselineskip}

\noindent Since all fields are optional one can assign
the markup to only a subset of the context arguments. The accessible
context arguments depend on the type of the object that is to be
output. We have not made available the whole context to the user, but
instead have selected a meaningful subset for each markup command.

The \term{context-based markup specification} allows, for example, to
assign a generic markup for all location reference classes with the
command
{\small%%
\begin{verbatim}
   (markup-locref :open  "\generic{"
                  :close "}")
\end{verbatim}
}%%
\noindent but redefining the markup for the instances of a certain
location class as follows:
{\small%%
\begin{verbatim}
   (markup-locref :class "special-class"
                  :open  "\special{"
                  :close "}")
\end{verbatim}
}%%

\noindent The event dispatcher has to decide which of the markup schemes
is the most specialised one that matches the given arguments.  In the
above situation the second markup is selected for a location reference
of class \texttt{special-class}, but for all others the generic markup
is used, as defined by the first command.

As an example of the run-time definition of methods consider the
following user interface declaration, which is specialised on all
three arguments,
%%
{\small\begin{verbatim}
   (markup-locref :open "\defin{" :close "}"
                  :attr "definition"
                  :class "pagenums"
                  :depth 1 ))
\end{verbatim}
    }
%%
\noindent roughly expands to
%%
{\small%%
\begin{verbatim}
   (progn
     (defmethod do-markup-locref-open
         ((attr      (eql #<attribute "definition">))
          (locrefcls (eql #<class     "pagenums">))
          (depth     (eql 1)))
       (do-markup-string "\defin{"))
     (defmethod do-markup-locref-close
         ((attr      (eql #<attribute "definition">))
          (locrefcls (eql #<class     "pagenums">))
          (depth     (eql 1)))
       (do-markup-string "}")))
\end{verbatim}
  }%%
\noindent Thus, we use \texttt{eql}-specialisation on objects for
all three specifiers. Both methods simply output the open (resp.\
close) tag by calling the function \texttt{do-markup-string}.

With this implementation the question of the \term{metrics} had to be
answered that that is used to find the \term{most-specialised} method
of a certain set of methods. The problem arises when considering an
event with the arguments (\emph{attr=definition},
\emph{locrefcls=pagenums}) that must dispatch to exactly one of the two
following methods:

{\small%%
\begin{verbatim}
   (defmethod do-markup-locref-open
      ((attr      (eql #<attribute "definition">))
       (locrefcls class) ... ))

   (defmethod do-markup-locref-close
      ((attr      attribute)
       (locrefcls (eql #<class "pagenums">)) ... ))
\end{verbatim}
  }

\noindent Both methods match the given event but since exactly one
method must be called the dispatcher must somehow decide what is the
most specialised method of both. Since the method dispatcher of \CLOS
has a built-in metric that always finds one most-specialised method we
simply use it to resolve this kind of ambiguity.\footnote{In \CLOS the
  first method would be selected since the first argument
  \emph{attribute} is more special than the second attribute. We have
  chosen the positions of the arguments in a way that seems to be most
  useful in practice.} If it is not resolved as desired one can define
another more-specialised method that resolves this amiguity
explicitly.

\bigskip

\noindent\textsf{Example 1: Tagging of Ranges}

\smallskip

\noindent A common way of tagging ranges of location references in an
index entry is as follows: a range of length 1 is printed with the
starting page number and the suffix `f.', those of length 2 with
suffix `f\kern0ptf.', and all others in the form `$x$--$y$'. Assuming
we want to achieve this for the location class \emph{pagenums} we can
specify the markup as follows:

{\small\begin{verbatim}
  (markup-range :class "pagenums" :close "f."  :length 1 :ignore-end)
  (markup-range :class "pagenums" :close "ff." :length 2 :ignore-end)
  (markup-range :class "pagenums" :sep "--")
\end{verbatim}
    }

\noindent The first two commands specialise on two different range
lengths, whereas the third command can be seen as the otherwise-case
that is invoked for all ranges which are not of length one or two. The
special switch \texttt{:ignore-end} causes the second location
reference to be suppressed in the resulting output.

\bigskip

\newpage

\noindent\textsf{Example 2: Tagging of Hierarchies}

\smallskip

\noindent Sometimes references to appendices are tagged in the following way:
\begin{center}
  \itshape A-1, A-7, A-11, B-3, B-4, B-5, C-1, C-8, C-12, C-13, C-22
\end{center}
\noindent This kind of markup can be achieved with the following
markup commands:

{\small\begin{verbatim}
   (markup-locref-list       :class "appendices" :sep ", ")
   (markup-locref-layer-list :class "appendices" :sep "-")
\end{verbatim}
}
\noindent The first command indicates that all location references
should be separated by a comma followed by a blank character. The
second line says that the different layers the location references
consist of shall be separated by a hyphen character. The location
reference \emph{A-1} consists of the following list of layers
(\emph{A}\ \emph{1}). Our example could also be output using a much
more compact form:
\begin{center}
   \itshape A 1, 7, 11; B 3, 4, 5; C 1, 8, 12, 13, 22
\end{center}
\noindent To achieve this markup one needs to transform the location
references into a hierarchy. This yields the location reference
\emph{A} and its sub-references \emph{1}, \emph{7}, and
\emph{11}. The following markup can then be used to obtain the
desired result:

{\small\begin{verbatim}
   (markup-locref-list :class "appendices" :depth 0           :sep "; ")
   (markup-locref-list :class "appendices" :depth 1 :open " " :sep ", ")
\end{verbatim}
}
\noindent The location references at depth zero are separated by a
semicolon whereas those at depth one are separated by a colon.


\section{Conclusion}

We have presented an efficient implementation of a simple
context-based markup algorithm in \CLOS. Our notion of efficiency
mainly concerns the elegance and simplicity of the implementation from
the programmers perspective.\footnote{This does not necessarily mean
  that the implementation is fast.} Our implementation mostly benefits
from three interesting properties of \CLOS, (a) the ability to define
methods at run-time using the macro expansion mechanism, (b) the
\texttt{eql}-specialisation feature that allows specialisation of
methods down to single instances of a class, and (c) the multi-method
dispatching paradigm. These features allow to implement the markup
algorithm with minimal effort. The resulting code is extremely compact
and easily maintainable and extensible. We think that our example is a
valuable demonstration of the usefulness of programming concepts such
as multi-methods.
