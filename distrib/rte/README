xindy (`fleXible INDexing sYstem') is a flexible index processor that
creates tagged index for publication system. xindy merges, sorts, and
outputs markup for raw index entries. It is highly configurable. It
supports many languages.

This is the source distribution of the xindy run time environment.
It consists of CLISP (see http://clisp.cons.org/) and the
xindy-specific CLISP module ordrules.

Release notes are available in the file NEWS, in this distribution.

This distribution is available from SourceForge, see
http://www.xindy.org/ for more information. That Web Site also
contains the most up-to-date information about xindy.


PURPOSE OF THIS DISTRIBUTION
----------------------------
This distribution will enable the creation of the xindy run time
environment. You will not have a functional xindy afterwards. For
that, you will also need the xindy kernel source, and the xindy
modules distribution.

The xindy kernel source distribution is named xindy-kernel-<version>.
The xindy modules distribution is named xindy-modules-<version>.
Both are also available from SourceForge.

If you just want to run xindy, your best bet is to download a full
xindy distribution that features all xindy styles (a.k.a. modules) and
a precompiled kernel for your architecture. These distributions are
named xindy-<version>-<platform>.


INSTALLATION
------------
Unpack the distribution archive, a directory xindy-rte-<version> will
be created. Usual steps follow:

    $ cd xindy-rte-<version>
    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ make install

The run time environment will be available in the subdirectories
binaries/. Copy it to the respective platform directory of the xindy
kernel source distribution and continue there.

Further make targets:

    all:	Create xindy run time engine anew, without CLISP check
    check:	Run CLISP check if compilation succeeded
    clean:	Discard everything that was created by make
    distclean:	Create state of distribution
