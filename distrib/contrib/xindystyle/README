This directory contains a LaTeX style with documentation that has been
developed by Andreas Schlechte. It directly supports xindy and makes
the usage of the filter program `tex2xindy' obsolete.

Run `latex xindy.ins' and the files xindy.sty and xindy.dvi will be
generated automatically.

Refer to the dvi-file for further documentation.

Please send comments and bug-reports to <Andreas.Schlechte@tu-clausthal.de>.
