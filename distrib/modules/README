This directory contains a set of predefined modules that can be used
to describe your own indexstyle. The directory is organized as
follows:

   lang/        contains several modules specifying alphabets and
		letter groups for several languages.

   enum/        contains more enumeration-types. See the header of
                each file for a description.

   ord/         some modules to construct ordering schemes

   class/       some example classes

   markup/      some markups for

   tex/		TeX-specific stuff

   misc/	everything that doesn't fit into the above categories.


These modules are intended to be used as a collection of examples that
can be used as a starting point for your own indexstyles. If you want
to profit others of your work, send us your indexstyles and we'll
incorporate your work into future releases.
