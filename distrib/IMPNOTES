xindy is largely written in Common Lisp. We have chosen Common Lisp
for several reasons. Common Lisp is a very powerful rapid prototyping
framework that allows for an efficient and maintainable
implementation. We started using C++ and soon switched to Lisp gaining
an productivity improvement by a significant factor. Since we make
heavy use of the object-oriented features of CLOS, the Common Lisp
Object System, and the dynamic nature of Lisp, other Lisp systems such
as Emacs' ELisp will not work.

We have chosen the Common Lisp implementation CLISP as the system of
our choice, since CLISP runs on all commonly used platforms ranging
from DOS/Windows (NT), OS/2 to many UNIX flavors. CLISP has a
relatively small memory footprint (2-4 MB) and is reasonably fast
compared to other Lisp systems.

For efficiency reasons we have added the GNU Rx regular expression
library and some piece of self-written C-code to the core Lisp system.

Currently we offer several binary distributions to free the users from
porting the Lisp system on their own. A full source version will be
available soon.
