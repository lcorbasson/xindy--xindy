This file describes how to install xindy on your system:

1. If you not have received a binary distribution for your preferred
   platform(s), get one and unpack it in this directory with

	gtar -xzvf xindy-<version>-<platform>.tar.gz

   The binaries are stored in the directory ./binaries/<platform>.

2. Change to the directory of the binary-distribution for which you
   want to install the system, e.g.

	cd ./binaries/<platform>

   Build the xindy system `xindy' with the appropriate directory settings.
   The following directory can be specified.

	LIBDIR    where the main executable `xindy.run', the dumped
		  file `xindy.mem' and the indexstyle-modules go.

   An example call might be

	make LIBDIR=/usr/local/lib/xindy

   This is also the default that is specified in the Makefile.

   Note: This only compiles xindy and modifies some scripts but does
	 *not* install anything!

   After a while (between 20 seconds and 5 minutes) you should receive
   a message saying that the compilation succeeded. If not, see file
   PROBLEMS for further hints.

   This step has produced a memory-image of the xindy-system in file
   xindy.mem. If you like, you can compress this file with gzip by
   additionally typing

	make gzipped

   which compresses xindy.mem and stores it under the same name.


3. The next step would be to run the testsuite on the whole system.
   Type

	make testsuite

   to run all tests. This may last some minutes (go, drink a cup of
   coffee) but will hopfully report that it has not found any errors.

4. After everything seems to be ok, you only need to install the
   system.

   The files should be installed as follows:

	cp xindy		<perhaps /usr/local/bin>
	cp xindy.run xindy.mem	XINDY_LIBDIR
	cp -R ../../modules     XINDY_LIBDIR
	cp ../../Doc		<where you store your docs>

   Its up to you to install all files properly. xindy is the only file
   that needs be reachable from the path. It searches for xindy.run
   and xindy.mem in LIBDIR.

5. Read the manual with your prefered viewer. Its located in the
   Doc-directory.

6. You're finished!
