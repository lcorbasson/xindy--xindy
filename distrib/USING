This file contains some information about using `xindy'.

Currently, no tutorial is available. So the main documentation can be
found in the manual that is located in the ./Doc subdirectory.

For a complete description of an indexstyle see the testsuite that is
located in the ./tests subdirectory.

The test `infII' contains a complete example of a real-world index
that was typeset using xindy as the index processor. Many features of
the indexstyle are demonstrated in file `infII.xdy'.

The test `mappings' demonstrates the usage of the module-mechanism
that we introduced.

The test `startup' simply tests, if xindy comes up at all.

In the subdirectory ./modules sample modules can be found that also
demonstrate some parts of the power of xindy.


If you have more questions, please contact us by mailing to

We are interested in your opinion.
