This file contains some information about using xindy.

Currently, no tutorial is available. So the main documentation can be
found in the manual that is located in the ./Doc subdirectory.

For a complete description of an indexstyle see the testsuite that is
located in the ./tests subdirectory.

The test `infII' contains a complete example of a real-world index
that was typeset uning xindy as the index processors. Many features of
the indexstyle are used in file `infII.xdy'.

The test `mappings' demonstrates the usage of the module-mechanism
that we introduced.

The test `startup' simply tests, if xindy comes up at all.
