This file contains some information about using `xindy'.

The main documentation can be found in the Tutorial and in the Manual
that can be found in the ./Doc subdirectory.


Additionally you can have a look at the testsuite which is located in
the ./tests subdirectory.

The test `infII' contains a complete example of a real-world index
that was typeset using xindy as the index processor. Many features of
the indexstyle are demonstrated in file `infII.xdy'.

The test `mappings' demonstrates the usage of the module-mechanism
that we introduced.

The test `startup' simply tests, if xindy comes up at all.

The tests `ex1' and `ex2' equal the examples that are used in the
tutorial.


In the subdirectory ./modules sample modules can be found that also
demonstrate some parts of the power of xindy.


If you have more questions, please contact us by mailing to

We are interested in your opinion.


Bye.
