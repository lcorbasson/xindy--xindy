xindy (`fleXible INDexing sYstem') is a flexible index processor that
creates tagged index for publication system. xindy merges, sorts, and
outputs markup for raw index entries. It is highly configurable. It
supports many languages.

This is the source distribution of the xindy kernel.
It consists of Lisp sources and needs the xindy run time environment
to get compiled.

Release notes are available in the file NEWS, in this distribution.

This distribution is available from SourceForge, see
http://www.xindy.org/ for more information. That Web Site also
contains the most up-to-date information about xindy.


PURPOSE OF THIS DISTRIBUTION
----------------------------
This distribution will enable the creation of the xindy kernel. You
will not have a functional xindy afterwards. For that, you will also
need the xindy modules distribution.

The xindy run time environment is named xindy-rte-<version>.
The xindy kernel source distribution is named xindy-kernel-<version>.
The xindy modules distribution is named xindy-modules-<version>.
Both are also available from SourceForge.

If you just want to run xindy, your best bet is to download a full
xindy distribution that features all xindy styles (a.k.a. modules) and
a precompiled kernel for your architecture. These distributions are
named xindy-<version>-<platform>.


INSTALLATION
------------
Get the run time environment first and build it.

Unpack the kernel distribution archive, a directory
xindy-kernel-<version> will be created. Copy the binary files from the
rte tree to the kernel tree:

    $ cp xindy-rte-<version>/binaries/* xindy-kernel-<version>/binaries
    $ cd xindy-kernel-<version>/binaries
    $ make

Compiled xindy consists of two files, xindy.run and xindy.mem.

Create tex2xindy:

    $ cd ../tex2xindy
    $ make

Copy the binaries into a xindy /opt directory; use one of the
distributions as example.

We know that we have to improve installation, that's why this
distribution is tagged as a pre-release.


KNOWN ISSUES
------------
Known problems and wanted enhancements of xindy are documented in our
SourceForge tracker system, accessible on the Web at
